Convolve two given signals (both are Asin(ωt)) and plot.

Signal 1: Amplitude: A1 = 10

Frequency: ω1 = 2Hz

Signal 2: Amplitude: A2 = .1

Frequency: ω2 = 20Hz

Time: t defined as: start = 0, end = 10, step = .01

Plot Directions:

In one figure, use subplots to plot the following 3 signals, Signal 1, Signal 2 and the signal
resulting from convolution of Signals 1 & 2.

Be sure to extract the last half of the resulting convolution to force the final plot to be of the
same length as Signals 1 & 2.

Save resulting plot as a PDF file.

Hint: Lookup pyplot from MatPlotLib in the online docs.
