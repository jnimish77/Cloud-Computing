# Project: Word-count using 11 node MPI Cluster & Data Analysis of its results using â€˜R
(Contributed by: Nimish Joshi, Ameya Kathapurrkar, Rushikesh Jagdale & Tahhan Sadaf Yusuf)


# Required files to implement the project are as followed:


   * 1.dictionary_new.csv
   * 2.searchtest.txt
   * 3.Nimish_finalcode.py (MPI code)
   * 4.r_final.R  (R code)

* To run the bash script type the following into the terminal

*Type

           $ chmod +x script-name-here.sh
           $ ./script-name-here.sh


  *inside the bash for an MPI process we would type the following command:

           $ mpiexec -n 11 python <location of the .py file> data cloud resources model machine hardware system application factor power 

*Later for R we would type the following

        $ Rscript r_final.R
