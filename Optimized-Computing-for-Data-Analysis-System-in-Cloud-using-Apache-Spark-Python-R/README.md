# Crime Data Analysis System:

* GUI (Graphical User Interface):
      * Aim of the project is to create an analytical system that will help to solve the issue towards the society by giving a visual and detailed overview of the crime information based on the data we have. 
In order to create such analytical system user friendly and accessible for any simple user without having any knowledge of cloud or spark, I have designed a GUI (Graphical User Interface). This will take input based on the provided option and will forward the selection to the SparkR based platform for further analysis.
The coding for this GUI is done in Python. I have used Tkinter library for such design approach. Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk.
Considering the fact that we have more than 2 GB of data (csv) file and millions of information inside it. Where we might need just few useful information because of the user need, this GUI will help to narrow down the search terms and facilitate an idea to process the result.

Options for the GUI incudes:

          1.city
          2.zipcode/ area name
          3. type of crime
          4. year
          5. Month
          6. Day/Date
          7. Time frame/window of the day (in hours)

* Here is a sample gui & design which shows the idea of end results.
